The Cville/UVa R meetup began in September 2014 as a the local R user group for the University of Virginia and Charlottesville area. Sponsored by the [UVA Library's Research Data Services](http://data.library.virginia.edu/), our goal is to support and share R experience and knowledge among users in the local community (and beyond).

We're a collection of novices and experts, the universty-affilitated and community-focused, enthusiasts and researchers, and lifelong learners of many stripes. Come join us!
