This is an R script ported from [here](https://github.com/UVa-R-Users-Group/meetup/blob/master/2014-09-08-kickoff-meetup-dplyr-demo/dplyr-nycflights13.R).

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
# Load packages
library("dplyr")
library("ggplot2")
library("nycflights13")
library("lubridate")
```




```{r}
# it's a data.frame, but also a tbl_df.
# doesn't print entire thing to screen.
flights
class(flights)
weather
planes
airports
airlines

# dplyr also gives you verbs. All take a tbl_df as first argument.
# on their own, not much that base R can't do.
## select particular variables from flights
select(flights, year, month, day)
## filter based on some condition. all fights taken by this plane.
filter(flights, tailnum=="N14228")
## mutate adds new columns. time made up in air:
mutate(flights, madeup=dep_delay-arr_delay)
## summarize reduces grouped data to a single row.
summarize(flights, avgdelay=mean(arr_delay, na.rm=TRUE))
## group_by turns existing table into grouped_df class
## summary operations are performed by the group
group_by(flights, dest)
summarize(group_by(flights, dest), avgdelay=mean(arr_delay, na.rm=TRUE))

# Combining
# 1. flights dataset
# 2. mutate to add "madeup" variable
# 3. filter it where madeup>60
# 4. select particular columns

# %>% as "then"
select(
  filter(
    mutate(flights,
      madeup=dep_delay-arr_delay
    ), madeup>60
  ), dep_delay, arr_delay, dest, madeup
)

flights
flights %>%
  mutate(madeup=dep_delay-arr_delay) %>%
  filter(madeup>60) %>%
  select(dep_delay, arr_delay, dest, madeup)

# add a date to flights

# How many each day from each origin?
flights %>% group_by(date, origin) %>% summarize(n=n())
# how many by week by origin?

# we can name a variable in the resulting tbl_df

# let's create new data grouped by week and destination

# why the dip at the end?
# let's get total number of flights by week
byweek %>% summarize(sum(n))

# only 364 days in year, Dec 31 is probably day 1 of week 53
52*7

# same plot but not looking at week 53

ymd("2013-01-01") + weeks(35) # labor day. why JFK continues decline?
ymd("2013-01-01") + weeks(47) # TG, xmas, NY

# why JFK lose number after labor day?
# LGA added a LOT more destinations just before this decline.
# makes more people fly out of there as opposed to JFK!
byweek %>%
  filter(week<=52) %>%
  ggplot(aes(week, ndests, colour=origin)) + geom_line()

# What causes delays?
# do older planes have more delays?

# first lets get the delay by date and origin

# how does weather affect flights?
