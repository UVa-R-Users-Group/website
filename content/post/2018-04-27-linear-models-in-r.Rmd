Linear models are among the most useful, versatile, and ubiquitous data analysis tools out there. R provides an enormous number of functions for building, manipulating, and analyzing linear models. This talk will focus on the basics, but will also touch on a few relatively advanced topics in the field, such as mixed-effects models, and general hypothesis testing frameworks. The goal is to provide beginners with insight into how to approach common data analysis problems with linear models, and to give seasoned practitioners a few new tricks to add to their toolkits.
