# UVa / Charlottesville R Users Group Website

This site is built with `library(blogdown)` and Hugo. It is styled with a slightly tweaked [Blackburn](https://github.com/UVa-R-Users-Group/website/tree/master/themes/blackburn) with page tweaks from [Simply Statistics](https://github.com/rbind/simplystats).

This repo stores code and examples shown at our meetups. Learn more about this group by visiting our [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/UVa-R-Users-Group/).

## Contributing:

If you want to add some content, maybe a past MeetUp talk you gave or a good R resource you found, that'd be great. Post an issue with relevant links or make a pull request from the current master and we will get your content added.

Per Hugo formatting new post content should always go into `content/post` and it can be either .md or .Rmd files.

## Conduct:

We want to ensure this group and this repo are welcoming for everyone. So we ask that everyone respectfully follow the [Contributer Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).
